# MeChat
A web-based chat application built using the MERN stack.

ChatApp is a real-time chat application that enables users to log in using their Google credentials and communicate with other users in real-time. It provides a seamless chatting experience with features like user authentication, online status indicators, and message history. It was created with WhatsApp by Meta as inspiration.

## Features

- **Google OAuth Login:** Users can quickly log in using their Google accounts, ensuring a secure and easy authentication process.

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Chat with other users in real-time, with instant message delivery.

- **Image Sharing:** Share images with other users to enhance your conversations.

- **Online Status:** See who's online and active with online status indicators next to user profiles.

- **Message History:** Access your chat history to review previous conversations.

- **User Profiles:** View user profiles, including their name and profile picture.

- **User Search:** Find other users by searching for their usernames.

## Future Plans and Scope

MeChat is continuously evolving. Here are some future plans and scopes for the application:

- **Voice Messages:** I am working on implementing the ability for users to send voice messages, adding a new dimension to your conversations.

- **Group Chats:** In the future, users will be able to create and participate in group chats, allowing for more collaborative and community-based communication.

- **Additional Features:** I am actively exploring and developing more features like message reactions, video calls, and more to make ChatApp even more versatile.
